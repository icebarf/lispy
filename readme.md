# BYOLISP_A

## Project Info
**This project is a work in progress LISP**
This lisp is not meant for programming purposes but rather is a fun project of mine. I decided to write thisas I wanted to learn C and do a fun project as well
The code used in this project is written by [Daniel Holden](https://github.com/orangeduck) which is present [on this webpage](https://github.com/orangeduck/BuildYourOwnLisp)
This book has been very insightful and fun to read and I am enjoying reading it.
Although you're free to use to this code is available under CC License, I am putting it under MIT License as it contains modifications and bonus project question code which is not written by Daniel Holden, anyway the project is in early stange and I am going to continue working on it slowly as I continue to explore the world of C.
I have also provided compiled binaries for windows and linux as well So that you can try what I have currently done
> Note: I will fully release when I finish reading the book
